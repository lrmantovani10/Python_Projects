Collection of some of my Python personal projects. Directories include:
* API:  API that provides users with relevant movie data, such as actors and movie genre. 
* Astrojump: A 2D Pygame-based game where players get points by collecting colorful circles on the screen and dodging incoming aliens. Scenarios include pixelated NYC and Paris.
* Capivara_Jump: 2D Pygame-based game in which you control a capybara that can kill enemies by jumping at them, and must also escape enemy threats by moving on the screen. Think battle royale but with a huge capybara. Inspired by my home town of Vicosa, Brazil.
* Data_Projects: Projects used to plot and predict trends using Matplotlib and scikit-learn. Subprojects include:
	* Human Development: Used to plot, analyze, and predict GDP progression by country over the next years
	* covid-19: Similar logic but for American counties during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
	* scikit_learn_sentiment_analysis.py: Sentiment analysis of book reviews using scikit-learn. ML preprocessing steps occurs through spaCy and Word2Vec files.
* Personal_Assistant: JARVIS-like personal assistant that captures the human voice and responds according to hard-coded conditionals. Loads with a cool Matrix-like effect powered by a batchfile. 
* Physics_Master: Python Physics simulations of phenomena such as gravity and light. Powered by the Physics_Master.py file.
* Sample_Projects: smaller, miscellaneous projects, such as a local database of police records, a LibreOffice automation tool, and a bibliographical reference generator.
